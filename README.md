TEST CODE FOR DMA-IDLE-LINE DETECTION USING UART

Steps:
1.create dma_buffer and uart_buffer with the sizes 64 and 256 respectively(the one used in this code)
2.created temporary buffer(type buffer in live watch it can be visible) 
3.Do not use the irq handlers that are generated by the stm32(comment them )and use the one that i have used in this code.(circular .c file)
4.set up break point at both irq handlers to understand the flow.
flow control:
1.as soon as you give the string in the terminal data will be in the dma_buffer(use live watch if needed)
2.usart irq handler is executed.
  the idle line detected and Disabling DMA will force transfer complete interrupt if enabled.
3.dma irq will be executed next and in this function the data from dma_buffer is copied to the uart_buffer(data is over written if 
reached the maximun size,since it is a circular buffer)
4.in this code i have copied data from uart_buffer to buffer(which is temp buffer). now we can process the data from buffer as per the 
requirement.
